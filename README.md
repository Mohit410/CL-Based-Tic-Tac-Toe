# CL-Based-Tic-Tac-Toe
Everybody remembers this paper-and-pencil game from childhood: Tic-Tac-Toe, also known as Noughts and crosses or Xs and Os. A single mistake usually costs you the game, but thankfully it is simple enough that most players discover the best strategy quickly. I have programmed Tic-Tac-Toe in Java and let's get playing!
## Getting Started
It is a two player game that is started by X.
To play this game you should have installed JVM on your machine and knowledge of some useful command in terminal.
### Prerequisites
1. Java Virtual Machine
2. Terminal Commands Knowledge
### How to Play
1. Download or clone the `Main.class` file to the local machine
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains `Main.class`
3. Type the following command in terminal to run the program- 
```
$java Main
```

#### OR
1. Download or clone the `Main.java` file to the local machine
2. Open the terminal and navigate to the directory that contains `Main.java`
3. Type the following command in terminal to compile source file - 
``` shell
$javac Main.java 
```
4. Type the following command in terminal to run the program- 
```shell
$java Main.java
```

#### Example Output:
